A 4-bit odd parity checker is a digital circuit used to verify the odd parity condition of a 4-bit binary data input.
Key Concepts:
1.	Parity: A parity bit is added to a group of binary bits to ensure that the total number of 1s (or 0s) in the group adheres to a specified parity rule.
o	Odd parity: The total number of 1s in the binary data (including the parity bit) must be odd.
2.	Parity Checker: It checks whether the data complies with the parity rule. For odd parity, the circuit verifies that the input has an odd number of 1s.
Operation:
•	The 4-bit odd parity checker takes four binary inputs: A,B,C,DA, B, C, DA,B,C,D.
•	It generates a parity status output, typically called PPP or Error\text{Error}Error.
o	P=1P = 1P=1: Indicates an odd parity (the number of 1s in the input is odd).
o	P=0P = 0P=0: Indicates a parity error (the number of 1s in the input is even).
